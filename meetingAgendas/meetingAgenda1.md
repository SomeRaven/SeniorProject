# Meeting Agenda 1
<small>Tuesday Jan. 27th, 2025</small>

### Progress since the previous checkpoint
This is the first meeting so, I have created a working database and server and three APIs that are Students, Parents, and Classes. Students have Parents and Classes but Parents and Classes have no ties to anything as this is the easiest way I have found to understand the structure so far. (Will change if needed) 
### Upcoming goals until the next checkpoint
I am planning to have a semi-working index to test the server and database not using postman. I want to have the admin login and user log in working by the next checkpoint. I am hoping to have a solid start for the admin dashboard by this time  
### Challenges impeding your future progress
I think having a login will be a bit of a refresh and I will have to work on how to get that working by the time I am hoping too. 
### Changes to your milestones (if any)
As of right now there are no changes to my milestones as I am on track so far though it is just the beginningâ€¦
