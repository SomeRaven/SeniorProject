# Project Proposal

### Problem Description 
STEM Center problem with checking in and checking out students.
</br>
STEM Center problem with collecting data due to reasons: 
- staff not taking accurate role (not taking role everyday, missing students due to students coming in late and or role being taken later when it wasn't taken when class happened, etc.)
- Pulling data from old ways of colleting data and or keeping data. (using excel and word docs.)

STEM Center having an issue when needing to access student information (parent phone number, parent email, what class the student is in)
</br>
STEM Center not keeping vauliable information and or data to help with getting grants and or funding. 
</br>
STEM Center not being able to manage student information with realitve ease (inputing student data into a spread sheet every semester.)
</br>
STEM Center has to input students that have been taking classes from them for mulitple semesters every semester. 
</br>
When the STEM Center had a Check out check in system in the past there would be a line that would form due to parents having to check in their child/children every class period. Creating annoynace with parents and lost time in class. 
</br>

### Proposed Soution 
Create a web based application that manages student information. This applation will also be able to export data for grant writing proposes. (Director wants to pull gender of students going back 5 years. System will give a csv of all students that attended classes going back five years with out repeating students. ) Parents will be able to register their child with an account that will be linked to them for every class they take. They will input their childs Name, Age, Grade, Birth date, any health conserns and or allerges and prefered pronouns as well as the parents Name, Phone Number, and Email. They will be able to add mulitple parent or adult contact information. They will then be issued a card like one would get from the library with the childs name in big letters, any medical information, and a barcode or qrcode that is specific to that child. This is what the parent will use to check their child in or out every class period and it will also serve as the childs name tag. Parents or older children will just scan their card at the front desk and head to their class. Done. 

This card will also be able to be scanned by staff on their phones to pull up all of the nessassery information such as the parents phone number or email, what class/classes that child is taking at the moment, etc. This will reduce time taken to find information from a excel sheet on a computer or from a printed out verison of that sheet.
